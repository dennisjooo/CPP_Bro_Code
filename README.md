# C++ Course by BroCode

You can look for the video [here](https://youtu.be/-TkoO8Z07hI). I did this course as my intro to C++ in general and I find that the video series was very easy to follow. 
It's not that detailed and generally catered towards beginners, so if you're into that, I think it might suits you.
Plus it's only 6 hours long and can get you writting some simple C++.

By the end of the video, I was very curious in separating the C++ codes into several files. 
Previously I have gone over Harvard's CS50 which uses C for the first few meetings and I remembered using a `.h` files, and how to basically tell the compiler to compile multiple files.
